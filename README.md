ðŸ“Š Master's Thesis: Profit Margin Analysis
âœ¨ Description
Welcome to my final Master's Degree project repository in collaboration with Naturgy! This project focuses on the automated analysis of profit margins, breaking them down by energy sources and monthly periods. Through programming and the creation of interactive dashboards in Tableau, Iâ€™ve developed a system to efficiently visualize and analyze complex datasets. This includes automating calculations to provide insights into both unitary and total margins, offering valuable decision-making support for commercial planning, control, and administration.

Please note: The data shared are fictitious and do not represent real customer information.

This repository includes the original Jupyter Notebook in Spanish and a translated PDF in English.

The repository includes detailed code, preprocessed data, original data provided by Naturgy, and interactive Tableau dashboards to enhance data visualization and exploration.
